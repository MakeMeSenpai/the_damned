# Preveious Updates Backlog
- 0.1.3
    - Added git master branches for safer development. This lets me experiment with feature requests and more without breaking the current game. As well walking enemies who follow the path now!

- 0.1.0
    - Background is now visual and ready!! Woot, woot! We are very much on our way to getting this thing off the ground and running.

- 0.0.8
    - place holders have been added, as well as a boat load of code that we still can't see. I don't suggest coding blidly, but when you are stuck, you still gotta keep working. As well, More Lore was added to this page to give you a better insight on the world I am trying to build here.

- 0.0.5
    - Nothing but a white screen appears. Not very exciting but there are currently issues with our Pygame's draw funcs. So Additions that have been added are all none-visible. Such as object creations etc.
